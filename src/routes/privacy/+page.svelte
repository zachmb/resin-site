        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how "Resin" ("we," "us," or "our")
            collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our iOS
            application and related services (collectively, the "App"). By using
            the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
            accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-resin-forest mt-8 mb-4">
            1. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <p>
            We believe in data privacy. The Resin app stores your mind maps,
            tasks, and notes locally on your device or via your private iCloud
            account. We do not transmit or store your personal textual data on
            our own servers without your explicit consent.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-resin-forest mt-8 mb-4">
            2. Use of Your Information
        </h2>
        <p>
            When you provide an API key (e.g., for Gemini AI features), that key
            is stored locally and used exclusively to communicate directly with
            the respective third-party service provider. We do not collect or
            monitor the contents of your AI queries.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-resin-forest mt-8 mb-4">
            3. Third-Party Services
        </h2>
        <p>
            The App may utilize third-party services (like Apple iCloud for sync
            or Google Gemini for AI capabilities). These services have their own
            privacy policies addressing how they use such information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-resin-forest mt-8 mb-4">
            4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
            We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
            you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
        </p>
