            By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access

            You retain all rights to any thoughts, data, tasks, notes, or other
            content you submit, post or display on or through the App. You are

            Our app provides an option to input third-party API keys (e.g.,
            Google Gemini) to unlock specific features. You agree that you are
            fully responsible for the usage, billing, and adherence to the terms
            and conditions of those third-party services resulting from the use
            of your provided keys.

            The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We
            provide no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the
            reliability or accuracy of the application or the third-party AI
            services it integrates with.
