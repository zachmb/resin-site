# Resin Brand Guidelines
Version 1.0 — Strategic Foundation Document

## 1. Brand Core

### Brand Name
Resin

### Brand Thesis
Resin closes the loop between thinking and doing.
Resin is not a productivity tool.
Resin is the system that converts intention into execution.

### Category
AI Executive Workspace

### Positioning Statement
For ambitious thinkers who are overwhelmed by their own ideas, Resin is the AI workspace that transforms notes into action. Unlike passive note-taking apps, Resin acts as a Chief of Staff—ensuring nothing meaningful remains unfinished.

## 2. The Target User: “The Overwhelmed Visionary”

### Who They Are
* Builders, founders, architects, writers, product leads, researchers
* High agency, high ambition
* Constant idea generation
* Chronic unfinished projects
* Dislike clutter and corporate aesthetics
* Value taste, restraint, and intellectual credibility

### Emotional State
* Mentally crowded
* Slightly behind their own potential
* Guilty about unfinished ideas
* Tired of “organizing” instead of progressing

### Core Desire
Not productivity.
Momentum.

They want to feel like the composed, effective executive version of themselves.

---

## 3. Psychological Foundation

### The Open Loop Problem (Zeigarnik Effect)
Unfinished tasks create psychological tension.
Resin resolves that tension.

**Messaging principle:**
Every note should feel like it is already moving toward completion.

### Cognitive Closure
Humans crave resolution.
Resin delivers closure at scale.

**Messaging principle:**
Resin does not store ideas. It finishes them.

---

## 4. Brand Personality

### If Resin Were a Person
* Calm
* Impeccably organized
* Never rushed
* Speaks slowly
* Dresses in earth tones
* Has excellent taste
* Rarely raises their voice
* Finishes what they start

### Tone Guidelines
* **Calm** – Never urgent or loud
* **Authoritative** – Speaks with certainty
* **Minimal** – No fluff, no filler
* **Intellectual** – Precise language
* **Essentialist** – Every word must earn its place

### Things We Do Not Do
* No exclamation marks
* No hype language (“game-changing,” “revolutionary”)
* No startup clichés
* No “AI-powered productivity solution”
* No corporate jargon

---

## 5. Messaging Pillars

### 1. Completion
Language focuses on finishing, resolving, closing.
*Examples:*
* “The quiet end to your unfinished projects.”
* “From Draft to Done.”
* “Where ideas conclude.”

### 2. Momentum
We sell forward motion, not storage.
*Replace:* “Organize your notes”
*With:* “Move your thinking forward.”

### 3. Executive Identity
We are selling who the user becomes.
*Replace:* “Track tasks easily”
*With:* “Operate with executive clarity.”

---

## 6. Competitive Positioning

### What Others Sell
* Organization
* Structure
* Documentation
* Knowledge storage

### What Resin Sells
* Progress
* Follow-through
* Resolution
* Intellectual control

### Narrative Frame (Internal Use)
Others are filing cabinets.
Resin is a Chief of Staff.

---

## 7. Voice & Copy Standards

### Headlines
Must imply transformation or completion.
Never describe features.

*Bad:* AI Note-Taking App
*Good:* The quiet end to your unfinished projects.

### Feature Descriptions
Describe outcomes, not mechanisms.

*Bad:* Calendar integration
*Good:* Your ideas appear on your schedule before you forget them.

### CTA Language
We do not “sign up.”

*Primary CTA:* Hire Resin
*Secondary options:* Begin the transition | Close the loop | Start finishing

*Never:* Get started | Try now | Sign up free

---

## 8. Visual Identity

### Primary Colors
* **Cream Background:** `#FDFBF7`
* **Dark Forest Green:** `#1A2E1A`

These should dominate 85–90% of the interface.

### Accent Colors
Use sparingly.
* **Burnt Orange:** For CTA emphasis and small highlights.
* **Sage Green:** For hover states and subtle transitions.

*Never use:* Bright tech blue, Neon gradients, Harsh contrast palettes.

---

## 9. Typography

### Headings
**Elegant Serif**
*Think:* New York Times, Literary journal, Kinfolk magazine
*Purpose:* Authority and intellectual weight.

### Body
**Clean Sans-Serif**
Neutral and restrained.
*Purpose:* Clarity and readability.

---

## 10. Layout Philosophy
* 3x more whitespace than feels comfortable
* Slow transitions
* Soft motion curves
* Nothing abrupt
* No visual noise

The site should feel like: *A well-kept study at golden hour.*

---

## 11. Animation Principles
Movement must communicate value.
The core animation: **Note → Calendar Event → Completed State**

It should:
* Be slow
* Be smooth
* Feel satisfying
* Viscerally demonstrate closure

*Never:* Fast UI gimmicks, Bouncy micro-interactions, Flashy loading spinners.

---

## 12. AI Framing Rules
*We never say:* Chatbot, Assistant bot, AI tool
*We say:* Executive Partner, Chief of Staff, Strategic Operator, Private COO

*Internal framing:* The AI is premium labor.

---

## 13. Social Proof Tone
Testimonials should sound like: Architects, Directors, Authors, Researchers
They should imply: Taste. Authority. Control.

*Example:* “It feels less like software and more like hiring a project manager who understands my taste.”

*Never:* Casual emoji testimonials, Overly enthusiastic startup quotes, Generic “10/10 would recommend”.

---

## 14. Website Structure Standard
All future landing pages should follow this emotional arc:
1. Identity Shift (Who you become)
2. Agitation (Dead storage problem)
3. Resolution (Chief of Staff framing)
4. Demonstration (Note → Action flow)
5. Social Proof (Intellectual validation)
6. Calm CTA

---

## 15. Product Language Rules
Inside the app:
*Rename:*
* Tasks → Commitments
* Reminders → Follow-ups
* Notes → Drafts (until activated)
* Archive → Resolved

Every word should reinforce motion and closure.

---

## 16. What Resin Is Not
* Not hustle culture.
* Not productivity maximalism.
* Not corporate workflow software.
* Not loud.
* Not chaotic.

Resin is calm power.

---

## 17. The Emotional Promise
When a user opens Resin, they should feel:
* Less mental noise
* More direction
* Quiet confidence
* Intellectual control
* Forward motion

If any update to the product or website increases noise, speed, clutter, or corporate tone, it violates the brand.

---

## 18. Internal Litmus Test
Before shipping anything, ask:
* Does this feel calm?
* Does this imply completion?
* Does this elevate the user’s identity?
* Would this exist in a luxury editorial magazine?
* Does this avoid startup cliché?

If not, refine.

## 19. One-Sentence Brand Summary
**Resin is the executive layer between your thoughts and your results.**
